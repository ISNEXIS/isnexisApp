# Placeholder Files

This directory contains placeholder files to help you understand the structure.

## To Add Your Custom Character:

1. Place your character sprite as: `character1.png`
2. The sprite should be:
   - PNG format with transparency
   - Square dimensions (e.g., 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
   - Facing forward or in your preferred direction

## Character Colors (if sprites are missing):

- Character 1: Blue (Your main character - add sprite here!)
- Character 2: Red (Optional sprite)
- Character 3: Green (Optional sprite)
- Character 4: Yellow (Optional sprite)

The game will automatically detect and use your sprites when available, and fall back to colored squares when not.
